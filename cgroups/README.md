# CGroups

This specification subdirectory is used to build and discuss a specification for Linux's _Control Groups_ and _Subsystems_.

The spec methodology will use _LaTeX_, _Z_ and _FÂµzz_, together with whiteboards and lots of talk.

The aim of this specification is to produce a sufficiently clear and precise description of control groups and associated subsystems (especially the memory ss) so that a robust and reliable control scheme can be built using it. The primary example, and the motivation for this project, is _Warden_.

The full introduction, specification and deliverables will be described in LaTeX documents (_*_`.tex`) in this directory.
